- 👋 Hi, I’m @richardmrodriguez
- 👀 I’m interested in developing user-friendly apps to help creatives read, write, or create with less walls and limitations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and particularly how to read, modify, and generate PDF files, as well as create multiplatform app creation with Kivy.
- 💞️ I'm still rather new to development and github, but I hope to spend more time contributing to my favorite projects, even if it's just spellchecking.
